## Introduction

A wise man said "Don't reinvent the wheel". It's true and it applies to software development. When developing a feature, I bet sometimes you were in a situation "I need a third party package". So, how to choose a library or package correctly? In the past, whenever I thought I need an external library, I just google it (e.g: react draw chart), choose a random package, then try it. If it works, I use it. But it turned out that the strategy was not very good. In this article, I am going to share some personal tips on choosing a javascript package. But these tips applied to any other language's library, framework, or even picking a language for your team.

### 1. Fit your need
![Software](/media/software.jpg)

It sounds obvious that you should choose a solution that solves your problem. A package usually tries to solve a set of problems in general. But sometimes, your use case is particular to your situation, and the package might not fit. Please make sure the third party code you are going to install handles sufficient, not too much, not too over engineer your problem. Many times, [DIY](#do-it-yourself) is a good option

### 2. Easy to adopt

In industry, you don't work alone. So, pick a solution that your team members are able to adapt to quickly. You don't want to choose a solution that you are the only one who can implement and maintain.

### 3. Popularity

It's usually true that a good solution is a popular one. If a solution is good, why isn't it popular? I measure the popularity of a javascript package by the number of github stars and the number of weekly downloads on [https://npmjs.com](https://npmjs.com). A package with a big community proves that it solves the problem for many people. It comes with the advantages of having better support when we run into an issue. The popular package has more maintainers, contributors and users, so it's more mature than the less popular ones. It usually has good documentation and tutorials, which helps you to easily adopt and use it correctly and efficiently.

**Bonus:** [https://stateofjs.com/](https://stateofjs.com/) is a great resource for you to know about the trending in javascript every year

### 4. In active development
![Team work](/media/teamwork.jpg)

It's very important that's you are choosing an active project instead of a dead/ unmaintained project. The active project gets better and better over time through community feedback. An unmaintained project does not move forward and does not fix functional bugs and patch security issues. Sometimes, a very popular package could get abandoned and go into the "freeze" state with many open issues and pull requests. It's might used to a great solution in the past, but maybe this is the sign for us we have to move on. An example is [https://github.com/jamiebuilds/react-loadable](https://github.com/jamiebuilds/react-loadable). It's a great solution for a very long time to split code in React. I totally love it. But's stale now with many issues and PRs since 2018 (this post is written at the end of 2021). Now, if I need to split code in React, I rather use https://github.com/gregberge/loadable-components, which is in active development, getting more popular, patch bugs reported by the community and most importantly, solve my problems. My personal advice: choose a package that active in the last 3-6 months, with issues are being resolved and PRs are being merged.

### 5. License
![License](/media/license.jpg)

It's very important that the package you install grant you permission to use it for commercial in production. Packages in the wild are great. But not all of them are free to use. 

Let's take an example. If you are working with charts, you might hear of [Highcharts](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts) - Rock-solid and incredibly flexible charting library made for developers. You download it from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), make a chart, it looks great, and you are ready to roll out the feature. But please note that Highcharts is not free for commercial. So if you are writing code for your company, haven't bought a license and use this package for production, you are basically breaking the law. We don't want that, right? So please buy a license before using Highcharts in production. Myself, I use [Recharts](https://github.com/recharts/recharts) instead, a free package powered by [D3](https://github.com/d3/d3) with MIT license and in very active development.

Software licenses are quite complicated and go beyond the purpose of this post. But in general, package with MIT, Apache 2.0 and BSD are safe to use for commercial. If you choose a package that's are not one of those, please please read the license carefully.

### 6. Reasonable size
![Size](/media/size.jpg)

You don't want to bloat your web application's bundle size by installing a 700kb package. Sometimes you need to, but most of the time, you don't. Please consider the size of the library before making a decision. You need to know about the unpack size, the bundle size, the gzipped size. A larger package means you need more hard disk and bandwidth, which means more money you need to pay, also it takes a longer time for your users to use your app.

### 7. DIY
![Do it yourself](/media/diy.jpg)

As mentioned in [Fit your need](#fit-your-need), many packages try to solve a problem in general (Thus the size of the package is large), you only need a small part of the package. Sometimes, your problem is unique and there are no existing third party packages out there to solve yours. In those cases, it's a great time for you to do it yourself. I find myself in the early days in the industry spending many times finding a third party package to help me build features. But over time, I rarely use external packages for my daily task. It doesn't mean that I always reinvent the wheel. It means that I know what I am doing and I can seek help from the community when I truly need to (for example I will never sanitize user input by myself but use [DOMPurify](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify))

**Bonus:** For some problems, if you cannot find a package helps you, just make one and give it to the world by making an open source software. You will receive more than you can think of.

## Conclusion

Above are my very personal tips, it might be true and it might not be true. If there's something you don't agree with, that's OK. Just ignore it, or better, let me know why you don't agree. If you have additional tips, please let me know in the comment section. I would love to hear from you. I wish you can choose the right packages for you and your team and happy coding.
