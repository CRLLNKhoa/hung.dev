_Me in a triathlon event_

🧑‍💻 I am currently a full-time open source contributor. Previously, I was working at [Got It](https://www.got-it.co/) as a Lead Frontend Developer.

⚡️ I am obsessed with Developer Experience (DX), so I created [jest-preview](https://github.com/nvh95/jest-preview) 🖼 to help frontend engineers to write and debug Jest tests effortlessly. If you are a frontend engineer, [check it out](https://github.com/nvh95/jest-preview). I promise you will love it 😍!

Besides, I also play triathlon.

I hope you enjoy my blog. You can reach me [here](/pages/contacts)
